# Quantum-Computing-Explorations-Qiskit-Tutorials-
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks from an ACM Quantum Computing Summer School I attended. These materials were provided by instructors, and I have thoroughly gone through, understood, and executed these tutorials to grasp fundamental and advanced concepts in quantum computing using Qiskit.
This collection demonstrates my proactive engagement with cutting-edge technologies and my ability to learn and apply complex scientific and computational principles.

Notebooks Included:
ACM_QC_Live_Tutorial.ipynb:

Focus: Introduction to classical computation, vectors, matrices, and basic Python programming concepts. This notebook served as a foundational warm-up to prepare for quantum computing topics.

Key Learnings: Familiarization with Jupyter environment, basic linear algebra operations in Python.

ACM_QC_Live_Tutorial_2.ipynb:

Focus: Core quantum computing concepts. This notebook delves into the basics of qubits, quantum states, and fundamental quantum gates (like u1, u2, u3, cx). It also introduces the concept of noise models in quantum simulation.

Key Learnings: Understanding quantum bit representation, applying single and multi-qubit gates, simulating quantum circuits with Qiskit, basic error analysis.

ACM_QC_Live_Tutorial_3.ipynb:

Focus: Advanced quantum algorithms and their implementation. This notebook explores more complex algorithms such as the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and potentially introduces concepts like quantum search (Grover's algorithm) or quantum compilers.

Key Learnings: Implementing quantum algorithms, understanding their theoretical underpinnings, using Qiskit for more intricate circuit construction and simulation.

Key Concepts Explored Across Tutorials:
Quantum Mechanics Fundamentals: Qubits, superposition, entanglement.

Quantum Gates: Hadamard, CNOT, Pauli-X/Y/Z, and other universal gates.

Quantum Circuits: Designing and simulating quantum circuits.

Quantum Algorithms: Deutsch-Jozsa, (and potentially Grover's Search or other relevant algorithms from your summer school schedule).

Qiskit: Practical application of IBM's open-source quantum computing framework.

Classical Computation Foundations: Reversible computation, randomized algorithms, complexity classes (P, NP).

Quantum Probability: Understanding probability in quantum mechanics.

Error Models: Introduction to simulating noise in quantum systems.
